# Lab 01: Journey into Hardware - Digital Design Odyssey

## Overview and Motivation

Welcome to our second lab! In this lab, we delve into the foundations of digital design, focusing on multiplexers and adder circuits. Starting with a 2-to-1 multiplexer constructed from basic logic gates, progressing to a 4-to-1 multiplexer using the 74150 chip, and integrating Arduino for practical testing, we aim to unravel the core principles of digital circuits in an accessible manner. The motivation is to demystify these components, fostering a deep understanding of the binary foundations that power digital technologies. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience with multiplexers, insight into their applications, and a fundamental grasp of how to design and test digital circuits.
